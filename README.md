This project is a fully functional, distributed food delivery platform built from the ground up using a microservices architecture with Spring Boot. It demonstrates key concepts in modern backend development, including service discovery, API gateway, asynchronous communication, and stateless security.

---

## Architecture

The system is decomposed into independent, domain-specific microservices that communicate with each other through a combination of synchronous REST APIs and asynchronous events via Kafka. All external traffic is routed and secured through a central API Gateway.



---

## Features

- **Service Discovery**: Services register with a Eureka server, allowing for dynamic scaling and resilience.
- **Centralized Entry Point**: A Spring Cloud API Gateway handles all incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate service.
- **Stateless Security**: End-to-end security using Spring Security and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The API Gateway validates tokens for all protected routes.
- **Asynchronous Messaging**: The Order Service communicates with the Notification Service asynchronously using Apache Kafka, creating a decoupled and resilient system.
- **User Management**: Full user registration and login functionality with secure, hashed passwords (BCrypt).
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Endpoints are protected based on user roles (e.g., `ROLE_USER` vs. `ROLE_ADMIN`).
- **Core Business Logic**: Full implementation of Customer, Restaurant, and Order management services.

## Project Structure

This project uses a monorepo structure to manage all the microservices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or higher
- Apache Maven
- PostgreSQL running locally
- Apache Kafka running locally (on `localhost:9092`)

### Configuration

This project uses environment variables to manage sensitive configuration. Before running, you must set the following variables in your IDE's run configuration for each service:

- `DB_USERNAME`: Your PostgreSQL username.
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Your PostgreSQL password.
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: A long, Base64-encoded secret key for signing JWTs.

### Running the Application

The services must be started in the following order:

1.  **Service Registry**
2.  **Customer Service**
3.  **Restaurant Service**
4.  **Order Service**
5.  **Notification Service**
6.  **API Gateway**

## API Endpoints

All requests should be sent to the **API Gateway** on port `8080`.
